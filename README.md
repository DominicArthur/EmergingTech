# ELIZA Chatbot

## Project Description
We were tasked with implementing a version of a ELIZA chatbot. The chatbot responds to the users input with a predefined patters using reflection logic to create an engaging conversation with a computer. I built it using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. It runs entirely on the client-side, with no external libraries or APIs. 
I really enjoyed this project, seeing how chatbots were first implemented to understand the origins of conversational AI, as AI has become a major part of modern computer science.
