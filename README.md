## Task 1: Introduction 
We were taskes to implement a trigram model, Its purpose is to analyze text data like books, to build a language model.
## How It Works:
1 - The test is first cleaned using the 'clean_text' function to remove all unwanted characters and to convert to uppercase.
2 - Trigrams extract from the cleaned test using the 'create_trigram' function.
3 - Used sample inputs to test its accuracy.
