### Introduction:
For this project I set up a trigram modle to explore its use in text modeling and generation, trigram modles analyze sequences of three consecutive characters to predict the likelihood of the next character in a sequence. I was tasked with building a trigram-based text model using any 5 texts from project gutenberg. From doing the project I was able to notice the potential use of trigrams for generating legable text as well as analyzing specific details in large scale text documents.

### How to Run
- First clone the repository to your machine.
- Locate the files needed.
- Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook trigrams.ipynb.
- Run the code cell by cell or all at once.
- Or
- Use github codespaces to run it.
