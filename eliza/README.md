## Introduction
We were tasked with implementing a version of a ELIZA chatbot. The chatbot responds to the users input with a predefined patterns using reflection logic to create an engaging conversation with a computer. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs entirely on the client-side, with no external libraries or APIs. 
I really enjoyed this project, seeing how chatbots were first implemented to understand the origins of conversational AI, as AI has become a major part of modern computer science.

## Features
- Interactive chatbot that accepts the users inputs.
- Uses reflection logic to make responses feel real for example I become you.
- Modeled after the orginial ELIZA program.
- Provides fall back responses for unrecognized inputs.
- Easy to use interactions with dark mode for better viewing
- Supports common phrases, greetings, and open-ended prompts for dynamic interactions.
- Functional with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
